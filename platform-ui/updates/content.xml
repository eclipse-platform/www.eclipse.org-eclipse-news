Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation
is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public
License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with this
Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.
For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,

          ECLIPSE FOUNDATION SOFTWARE USER AGREEMENT
March 17, 2005

Usage Of Content

THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR
OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY &quot;CONTENT&quot;).
USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR
NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU
AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT
AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS
OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation
is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public
License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with this
Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.
For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse.org CVS
repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available
as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).

- Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering,
extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;),
plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).
- Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java? ARchive)
in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.
- A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.
Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;.
Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version
numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
- Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files
named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.

Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Files named
&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers of
Included Features.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be
contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained
in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and Feature
Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module
including, but not limited to the following locations:

- The top-level (root) directory
- Plug-in and Fragment directories
- Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
- Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
- Feature directories

Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the
Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license (&quot;Feature Update
License&quot;) during the installation process. If the Feature contains
Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you
with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or inform
you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in
the &quot;license&quot; property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot;. Such Abouts,
Feature Licenses and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and
conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your
use of the associated Content in that directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER
TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):

- Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
- Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)

OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation
is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public
License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with this
Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.
For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.

- Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering,
extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;),
plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).
- Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java? ARchive)
in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.
- A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.
Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;.
Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version
numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
- Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files
named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.

Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Files named
&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers of
Included Features.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be
contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained
in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and Feature
Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module
including, but not limited to the following locations:

- The top-level (root) directory
- Plug-in and Fragment directories
- Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED
BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.

Applicable Licenses

Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation
is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public
License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with this
Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.
For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
