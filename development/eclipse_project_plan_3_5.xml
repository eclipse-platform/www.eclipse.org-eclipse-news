<p>
Last revised 13:00 ET May 13, 2009 (<img src="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/new.gif" alt="(new)" border="0" height="12" width="12" /> marks
interesting changes since the previous draft of April 3, 2009)
</p>
<p><i>Please send comments about this plan to the</i> <a href="mailto:eclipse-dev@eclipse.org">eclipse-dev@eclipse.org</a> <i>developer
  mailing list.</i>
</p>
<p>This document lays out the feature and API set for the next feature release
  of the Eclipse SDK after 3.4, designated release 3.5.
</p>

<p>Plans do not materialize out of nowhere, nor are they entirely static. To
  ensure the planning process is transparent and open to the entire Eclipse community,
  we (the Eclipse Project PMC) post plans in an embryonic form and revise them
  throughout the release cycle. </p>
<p>The first part of the plan deals with the important matters of release deliverables,
  release milestones, target operating environments, and release-to-release compatibility.
  These are all things that need to be clear for any release, even if no features
  were to change. </p>
<p>The remainder of the plan consists of plan items for all of the sub-projects
  under the top level Eclipse Project. Each plan item covers a feature or API
  that is to be added to the Eclipse Project deliverables, or some aspect of
  the Eclipse Project that is to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry
  in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title and a concise summary (usually
  a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably high enough level
  so that everyone can readily understand what the work item is without having
  to understand the nitty-gritty detail. </p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite large,
  others, quite small. Some plan items may involve work that is localized to
  a single component; others may involve coordinated changes to several components;
  other may pervade the entire SDK. Although some plan items are for work that
  is more pressing than others, the plan items appear in no particular order. </p>
<p>With the previous release as the starting point, this is the plan for how
  we will enhance and improve it. Fixing bugs, improving test coverage, documentation,
  examples, performance tuning, usability, etc. are considered routine ongoing
  maintenance activities and are not included in this plan unless they would
  also involve a significant change to the API or feature set, or involve a significant
  amount of work. The intent of the plan is to account for all interesting feature
  work. </p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are considering
    addressing for the release. Although we are actively investigating it, we
    are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say that we won't be able
    to address it. After due consideration, a proposal will either be committed
    or deferred.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it
    in to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note
    as to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed
    plan items at a later point.</li>
</ul>

<p:target_environments>

<div>
<p>In order to remain current, each Eclipse Project release targets reasonably current
  operating environments.</p>
<p>Most of the Eclipse SDK is &quot;pure&quot; Java code and has no direct dependence
  on the underlying operating system. The chief dependence is therefore on the
  Java Platform itself. Portions are targeted to specific classes of operating
  environments, requiring their source code to only reference facilities available
  in particular class libraries (e.g. J2ME Foundation 1.0, J2SE 1.3 and 1.4,
  etc.).</p>
<p>In general, the 3.5 release of the Eclipse Project is developed on a mix
  of Java 1.4, Java 5 and Java 6 VMs. As such, the Eclipse SDK as a whole
  is targeted at all modern, desktop Java VMs. Full functionality is available for
  1.4 level development everywhere, and extended development capabilities are made
  available on the VMs that support them.</p>
<p><a href="#Appendix1">Appendix 1</a> contains a table that indicates the class
  library level required for each bundle.</p>
<p>There are many different implementations of the Java Platform running atop
  a variety of operating systems. We focus our testing on a handful of
  popular combinations of operating system and Java Platform; these are our <em>reference
  platforms</em>. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating environments
  beyond the reference platforms we test. However, since we do not systematically test
  them we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on a
  non-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will
  be given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference platform.</p>
<p>Eclipse 3.5 is tested and validated on the following reference platforms
  (this list is updated over the course of the release cycle):</p>

<p>As stated above, <i>we expect that Eclipse works fine on other current
  Java VM and OS versions but we cannot flag these as reference platforms without

<p:internationalization>
<p>The Eclipse SDK is designed as the basis for internationalized products. The
  user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, including dialogs
  and error messages, are externalized. The English strings are provided as the
  default resource bundles.</p>
<p>Latin-1 and DBCS locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK on all reference platforms;
  BIDI locales are supported by the Eclipse SDK everywhere but on Motif.</p>
<p>The Eclipse SDK supports GB 18030 (level 1), the Chinese code page standard,
  on Windows XP and 2000, Linux/GTK and the Macintosh.</p>
<p>German and Japanese locales are tested.</p>

<p:compatibility_with_previous_releases>
<div>

<h3>Compatibility of Release 3.5 with 3.4</h3>
<p>Eclipse 3.5 will be compatible with Eclipse 3.4 (and all earlier 3.x versions).</p>

<p><strong>API Contract Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.5 will be upwards
  contract-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.4 except in those areas noted in the
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_5_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.5 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. Programs that use affected APIs and extension points will need to be ported
  to Eclipse SDK 3.5 APIs. Downward contract compatibility
  is not supported. There is no guarantee that compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.5
  APIs would ensure compliance with Eclipse SDK 3.4 APIs. Refer to
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">
    <em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em>
  </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain contract compatibility.</p>
  
<p><strong>Binary (plug-in) Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.5 will be upwards
  binary-compatible with Eclipse SDK 3.4 except in those areas noted in the
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_5_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.5 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. Downward plug-in compatibility is not supported. Plug-ins for Eclipse SDK
  3.5 will not be usable in Eclipse SDK 3.4. Refer to
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Evolving_Java-based_APIs">
    <em>Evolving Java-based APIs</em>
  </a> for a discussion of the kinds of API changes that maintain binary compatibility.</p>
  
<p><strong>Source Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.5 will be upwards source-compatible
  with Eclipse SDK 3.4 except in the areas noted in the
  <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/porting/eclipse_3_5_porting_guide.html" target="_top">
    <em>Eclipse 3.5 Plug-in Migration Guide</em>
  </a>. This means that source files written
  to use Eclipse SDK 3.4 APIs might successfully compile and run against Eclipse
  SDK 3.5 APIs, although this is not guaranteed. Downward source compatibility
  is not supported. If source files use new Eclipse SDK APIs, they will not be
  usable with an earlier version of the Eclipse SDK. </p>
  
<p><strong>Workspace Compatibility:</strong> Eclipse SDK 3.5 will be upwards
  workspace-compatible with earlier 3.x versions of the Eclipse SDK unless noted.
  This means that workspaces and projects created with Eclipse SDK 3.4 .. 3.0 can be successfully
  opened by Eclipse SDK 3.5 and upgraded to a 3.5 workspace. This includes both
  hidden metadata, which is localized to a particular workspace, as well as metadata
  files found within a workspace project (e.g., the .project file), which may
  propagate between workspaces via file copying or team repositories. Individual
  plug-ins developed for Eclipse SDK 3.5 should provide similar upwards compatibility
  for their hidden and visible workspace metadata created by earlier versions;
  3.5 plug-in developers are responsible for ensuring that their plug-ins recognize
  metadata from earlier versions and process it appropriately. User
  interface session state may be discarded when a workspace is upgraded. Downward
  workspace compatibility is not supported. A workspace created (or opened) by
  a product based on Eclipse 3.5 will be unusable with a product based on an earlier
  version of Eclipse. Visible metadata files created (or overwritten) by Eclipse
  3.5 will generally be unusable with earlier versions of Eclipse. </p>
  
<p><strong>Non-compliant usage of API's</strong>: All non-API methods and classes,
  and certainly everything in a package with &quot;internal&quot; in its name,
  are considered implementation details which may vary between operating environment
  and are subject to change without notice. Client plug-ins that directly depend
  on anything other than what is specified in the Eclipse SDK API are inherently
  unsupportable and receive no guarantees about compatibility within a single
  release much less with earlier releases. Refer to
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-API%20use/eclipse-api-usage-rules.html">
    <em>How to Use the Eclipse API</em>
  </a> for information about how to write compliant plug-ins. </p>

<p:themes_and_priorities>

<p:preamble>
<div>
<p>The plan items listed below were defined according to contributor requirements and the Eclipse
  <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/RequirementsCouncilThemesAndPriorities">Themes and Priorities</a>
  set forth by the Eclipse Requirements Council. Each plan item covers a feature or API that is
  to be added to the Eclipse Project deliverables, or some aspect of the Eclipse Project that is
  to be improved. Each plan item has its own entry in the Eclipse bugzilla database, with a title
  and a concise summary (usually a single paragraph) that explains the work item at a suitably
  high enough level so that everyone can readily understand what the work item.</p>
<p> Although there are four projects under the top-level Eclipse Project, there
  is a significant amount of commonality and shared effort between them. In general,
  many plan items involve coordinated changes to multiple components, and thus
  attempting to separate the items into sections based on sub-project leads to
  artificial distinctions between them (e.g., Platform Text vs. JDT Text, Platform
  Debug vs. JDT Debug, etc.). As such, this plan covers the work of all projects
  under the top level Eclipse Project.</p>
<p>Not all plan items represent the same amount of work; some may be quite
  large, others, quite small. Although some plan items are for work that is 
  more pressing than others, the plan items appear in no particular order.
  See the corresponding bugzilla items for up-to-date status information on
  ongoing work and planned delivery milestones.</p>
<p>The current status of each plan item is noted:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Committed</b> plan item - A committed plan item is one that we have
    decided to address for the release. In bugzilla, this is reflected by
    having a concrete target milestone assigned.</li>
  <li><b>Proposed</b> plan item - A proposed plan item is one that we are
    considering addressing for the release. Although we are actively
    investigating it, we are not yet in a position to commit to it, or to say
    that we won't be able to address it. After due consideration, a proposal
    will either be committed or deferred. In bugzilla, such items are reflected
    by having a target milestone "3.5" or "---" assigned.</li>
  <li><b>Deferred</b> plan item - A reasonable proposal that will not make it in
    to this release for some reason is marked as deferred with a brief note as
    to why it was deferred. Deferred plan items may resurface as committed plan
    items at a later point. In bugzilla, such items are reflected by having
    a target milestone "Future" assigned.</li>

  <strong>Performance testing infrastructure improvements.</strong>
  We will improve our performance test infrastructure and result pages and ensure

  Although performance did not significantly degrade during the 3.4 release cycle,
  we were unable to make the level of investment in performance improvements that
  we had hoped for. In 3.5, we will dedicate significant effort to identifying and
  ameliorating performance problems, both in typical Eclipse workflows and in more
  extreme scenarios.

<p:theme name="Robustness">
<p:description>
<p>As the basis for the entire Eclipse eco-system, the Eclipse SDK must be robust,
  flexible and secure. This work will address those issues by providing API for
  missing or currently internal functionality, and focusing on the issues that
  effect the stability of the platform.
</p>
</p:description>

<p:committed>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>API Tools test suite and infrastructure</strong>
  We will build a comprehensive regression test suite for our API tools, as well
  as a performance test suite, and enhance analysis to avoid false positives, allow
  special privileges between x-friend bundles, and detect when new API is used in
  a prerequisite bundle that requires a version range adjustment. We will also 
  investigate architectural changes to support binary or source analysis and 
  performance improvements. [PDE]

<li>
  <strong>Compare editor improvements.</strong>
  We will address some of the limitations of the current compare editor framework.
  Possible work areas include: pluggable compare viewers/tools, automatic updating
  of differences, better presentation for changes, support for auto-merge, ability
  to hide outgoing annotations, better handling of hunks, and more
  features from standard editors within compare editors.[All]

  <strong>API Tools enhancements</strong>
  We will enhance the capabilities of our API tools. Potential work areas include
  validating system library references based on a bundle’s required execution
  environment; analyzing extension points for compatibility and considering extension 
  point modifications in bundle version validation; implementing API comparison
  utilities that can be used to create reports in an automated build or presented 
  as a structural compare in the workbench; and providing tooling for package version
  definition and validation. [PDE]

<li>
  <strong>User-assistance improvements.</strong>
  We will provide a number of often asked for improvements to our help support,

  <strong>Extensible execution environments.</strong>
  Currently, the set of system library profile definitions supported by Equinox
  is static (for example, J2SE-1.4, J2SE-1.5, etc.). We will respond to new
  support being added by Equinox for an extensible set of system library profiles.
  Default compiler options will be associated with each profile for creating new

  enhance product definition with start levels and license information and support
  creation from OSGi launch configurations; honor the dropins folder when building
  and resolving plug-in and feature dependencies; support parallel compilation of
  bundles, incremental building, features with cyclic dependencies, exporting existing
