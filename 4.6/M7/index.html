  <tr id="import-projects">
    <td class="title">Import projects</td>
    <td class="content">
    A new <b>Import Projects</b> wizard is available via the <b>File &gt; Open Projects...</b> menu and via the general
    <b>Import...</b> command under <b>General &gt; Projects from Folder or Archive</b>.
    <p>
      Compared to other ways to import or create projects, this wizard aims at being a universal wizard that,
      from a source directory or archive, can detect and configure various kinds of projects.
    </p>
    <p>
       <img src="images/import-projects.png" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      This wizard relies on an extensible set of strategies that look at the content of the import source
      to detect file types, project layout patterns, or even look into some files in order to deduct which folders should be
      turned into projects and how those should be configured. Configuration usually involves setting up project natures and
      preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The import strategies are contributed via the new extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.projectConfigurator</code>, so that other IDE components
      can contribute detection and configuration specific to the technology they're supporting.

  <tr id="dark-theme-styled-text-scrollbar">
    <td class="title">Themed scroll bar enabled for editors in dark theme</td>
    <td class="content">
    It's now possible to replace the native scroll bar of a StyledText by a styled overlay. This is enabled
    by default in the dark theme on Windows.
    <p>
    <img src="images/themed-scroll-bar.png" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
    This feature can be disabled in the Windows dark theme by setting the <code>swt.enable.themedScrollBar</code> 
    VM argument to <code>false</code> (or enabled on the dark theme for other platforms by setting it to true)
    in eclipse.ini or on the command line after <code>-vmargs</code>:
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>-Dswt.enable.themedScrollBar=false</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Note that it may be added through css to any theme (see 
    <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/diff/bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/plugin.xml?id=742d2e990765d5bbf9be61ff3f047105f8102bd3">

    -- the user may always override the theme setting by using the <code>swt.enable.themedScrollBar</code> VM argument.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Caveats</b>: We're aware that the themed scroll bar is not currently available for all
    elements (such as trees and tables), and some places where the scroll bar was
    invisible (such as compare editors) may now show a scroll bar. These will only
    be fixed for Eclipse 4.7.

    <td class="content">
        Previously, the entries in the <b>Capabilities</b> preference page were displayed in a list. If you wanted to edit them, you had to open an extra dialog.
        Now you can directly enable or disable the capabilities from the preference page, as depicted in the following screenshot.
      <p>
        <img src="images/simplified-capabilities-page.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this dialog has API to prevent advanced editing, if the property ALLOW_ADVANCED is set to false, the original list
        is maintained and will be shown, which allows you to enable/disable only the main categories (not individual capabilities).

      <p><img src="images/eclipse-quick-access-improved-search.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>You can now restrict the search to Views, Commands, etc. by typing the category name followed by a colon. 
      For example, to filter the list of all the views, start typing <code>"Views: "</code> in the search-box.</p>
      <p>
      A few usability bugs have been fixed: The tooltip shows the keyboard shortcut,
      the number of search results per category is independent of the size of the proposals window,
      and the list with previous choices already opens when you click the field with the mouse.
