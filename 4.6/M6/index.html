    	This avoids a common error in Eclipse RCP implementations in which <code>@PostConstruct</code> 
    	was resolved to different classes in the bundle classpath.
    	This change is backwards compatible, i.e., a dependency with a minimum version still works correctly.

    This feature is a continuation of the High-DPI enhancements that were delivered in Mars release <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/M6/#high-dpi">4.5</a>.
    SWT toolkit now inherently supports autoscaling of images on High-DPI monitors on Windows and Linux, similar to the OS support provided on Mac OSX. 
    In the absence of high resolution images, SWT will auto-scale the images, layouts and widgets to ensure that Eclipse/SWT based applications are scaled proportionately to the DPI of the monitor.
    <p>
    Refer, below screen-shot showing Eclipse icons 'Before' and 'After' SWT autoScale feature:
    <img src="images/SWT-HighDPI-Support.png" alt="SWT-AutoScale-Feature" />
    </p><br/>
    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> By default, autoScaling is enabled on Windows, GTK and Mac Cocoa.<br/>
    This feature can be disabled on Windows &amp; GTK by setting this VM argument to 'false' in eclipse.ini or Run-configuration:
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>-Dswt.enable.autoScale=false</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Autoscaling cannot be disabled on Mac as it is provided by the OS.

  <tr id="null-analysis-generics">
    <td class="title">Improved null analysis with generics</td>
    <td class="content">
      The interplay of null annotations and generics has been improved in several regards.
      <p>
      The basic concepts had already been documented in the 
      <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/task-using_null_type_annotations.htm%3Fcp=1_3_9_1_0%23generics">online help</a>,
      but not all that was documented was actually checked by JDT's null analysis. With the changes outlined below,
      null analysis based on type annotations is even more capable than previous versions.
      </p>
      <p><b>(1)</b> The <b>first batch of contributed improvements</b> implements what we call "pessimistic analysis for free type variables",
      	which affects <em>implementors</em> of generic types.
      </p>
      <p><a href="images/MyGenericImpl.java.txt"><img src="images/pessimistic-analysis.png" alt=""/></a></p>
      <p>In order to allow clients to instantiate such a generic class with either a <code>@NonNull</code> or a <code>@Nullable</code> type
      as substitution for the "free type variable" <code>&lt;T></code>, the implementation of that class must account for the worst in both directions:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>To anticipate a <code>@NonNull</code> type, each field typed to a free type variable must be initialized with a non-null value, and
      	passing <code>null</code> where <code>T</code> is expected is illegal</li>
      <li>To anticipate a <code>@Nullable</code> type, each dereference must be preceded by a null check.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      At the bottom of each problem hover you will find a link to the corresponding configuration option,
      should you like to change the severity of this diagnostic. Note that configurability is mainly
      given for smooth migration from previous JDT version; conceptually, problems detected by pessimistic
      analysis should be treated as errors, because they invalidate the null-guarantees given by a generic type.
      </p>
      <img src="images/configure-pessimistic-analysis.png" alt="configuration options for new diagnostics"/>
      <p><b>(2)</b> The <b>second improvement</b> concerns <em>consumption</em> of generic types from a library, more specifically:
      	invocations of library method whose return type is given by a free type variable.<br/>
      	If the library type is instantiated with a <code>@NonNull</code> type as the type argument,
      	we generally want to interpret the mentioned return type as non-null, too.
      	This is problematic only for some "legacy" methods, which may return <code>null</code> without declaring so.
      	The most prominent example is <code>java.util.Map.get(K)</code> (see also the news entry on
      	<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.5/jdt.php#external-annotations">external annotations</a>,
      	which also demonstrates the clean solution to this issue).
      </p>
      <p>The analysis cannot see whether absence of a null annotation for such a return type is intentional
      (in the above sense of "free type variables"), or an omission that should be fixed.
      For that reason a new warning has been implemented to alert about this situation.
      </p>
      <a href="images/Client.java.txt"><img src="images/unsafe-nonnull-interpretation.png" alt=""/></a>
      <p>In the above example, both fields <code>list</code> and <code>map</code> provide <code>@NonNull String</code> as a
      type argument, hence the return types of both <code>get</code> methods are interpreted as non-null.
      For <code>List</code> this is desired, for <code>Map</code> it is a bug.
      </p>
      <p>The dilemma can be resolved by adding a (possibly empty) external annotation file (<code>.eea</code>)
      to each affected library class. By using an empty annotation file, the user signals that all types
      in this class should be interpreted verbatim (like in the <code>List</code> case - use with care).
      In the other case the missing <code>@Nullable</code> annotation should be added as an external annotation
      (like in the <code>Map</code> case).
      </p>
      <p>In a project that is not yet configured to use external annotations for the library in question,
      the warning is demoted to level "information". Generally, the severity of this problem is configured
      using the option right below the one mentioned above, titled <b>Unsafe '@NonNull' interpretation
      of free type variable from library</b>.</p>
      <p><b>(3)</b> <b>Finally</b>, a small utility class, <code>org.eclipse.jdt.annotation.Checks</code>, 
      has been included in the bundle <code>org.eclipse.jdt.annotation_2.1.0</code>
      containing helper methods for typical idioms for improving and documenting null safety.</p>

    	OSGi Declarative Services provide a powerful mechanism for developing complex, service-oriented

    	descriptor files from appropriately annotated Java source. This is done without requiring 
    	any additional builder to be configured in your project.
    	</p>
    	<p>
    	When you annotate your component implementation classes with <code>@Component</code>, and any
    	reference bind methods with <code>@Reference</code>, PDE will validate your annotations
    	and generate the corresponding component descriptor files. Any errors discovered during validation
    	are highlighted and reported.
