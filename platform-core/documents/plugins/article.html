  <p><b>Summary</b><br>
    <br>
    The Eclipse Platform is based on the notion of plug-ins. Plug-ins are a simple 
    but powerful mechanism that allow developers and users to construct complex 
    tool sets by composing functionality (i.e., plug-ins). There are of course 
    a number of subtleties in how plug-ins are defined and how they interact. 
    This article attempts to demystify plug-ins and make it easier to create and 
  manage Eclipse Platform configurations.</p>

  <hr width="100%">            
  <h2>Why Plug-ins?</h2>
               
  
<p>One of the main design points of the Eclipse Platform is that it is extremely 
  extensible. Another is that it is uniform. The Eclipse plug-in model is key 
  in satisfying both of these goals. A plug-in is a piece of functionality which 
  can be added to the Platform. Tools or applications are constructed by creating 
  one or more plug-ins. How tools or applications are factored into plug-ins depends 
  on the nature of the tool or application. </p>
<p>The Eclipse Platform itself, for example, is made up entirely of plug-ins: 
  some 50 or so in all. Even the runtime which manages plug-ins, is itself a plug-in! 
  Plug-ins interact via well defined API's. Since everything is a plug-in and 
  plug-ins interact via public interfaces, all plug-ins are equal in the system. 
  There are no plug-ins which get special treatment or privileges. For example, 
  the Workbench UI is a plug-in which presents the resource model defined by the 
  Resources plug-in. Since the Workbench accesses the Resources plug-in only via 
  API, all other plug-ins have exactly the same opportunities for manipulating 
  resources.</p>
<p>It follows from this, that capabilities are added to the Platform incrementally, 
  by adding plug-ins. Each new plug-in ties into the API of existing plug-ins 
  and provides new functionality. Still other plug-ins then build on the API of 
  these new plug-ins to add still more functionality to the Platform. And so on...</p>
               
  
<p>Another design point that makes Eclipse extremely extensible is its policy 
  of lazy plug-in activation. Only those plug-ins with code that is actually being 
  used are activated. Lazy activation is key to supporting a large base of installed 
  plug-ins, only some of which are needed in any given user session. Until a plug-in's 
  code is loaded, it has a negligible memory footprint and impact on start up 
  time.</p>
<h2>What is a Plug-in?</h2>
<p>Note: This article covers plug-ins as they are in Eclipse 2.1. While there
  are some changes coming in Eclipse 3.0, the basic model described here will
  continue to be accurate.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, plug-ins
    are defined by an XML <em>manifest
      file</em> called <code><strong>plugin.xml</strong></code>. An example plug-in
      manifest is shown below. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;plugin
    id="com.example.myplugin"
    name="My Plugin"
    version="2.0.0"
    provider-name="Example Plug-ins Inc."&gt;<br>&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Each plug-in is contained in a file system directory or at a base URL on a 
  server, with a plug-in manifest file (as seen above) and anything else it needs. 
</p>
<p>A typical plug-in consists of Java code in a JAR library, some read-only files, 
  and other resources such as images, web templates, message catalogs, native 
  code libraries, translation files, etc. Most plug-ins contribute executable 
  code though not all. Documentation plug-ins, for example, contribute online 
  help in the form of HTML pages. If a plug-in does contain code it must either 
  be written in Java or be callable from Java. </p>
<p>The above plug-in example is very simple. The following sections show how the 
  following elements of the plug-in architecture are used to round out the specification 
  of a plug-in.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Libraries</b> define the location of executable code. </li>
  <li><b>Prerequisites</b> define dependencies between plug-ins. </li>
  <li><b>Extension points</b> allow other plug-ins to contribute information in 
    a well-defined manner. </li>
  <li><b>Extensions</b> contribute information to the extension points of other 
    plug-ins. </li>
  <li><b>Fragments</b> allow a plug-in to be extended without the need to modify 
    anything related to the existing plug-in. </li>
</ul>
<h2>What is a Library?</h2>
<p>The first thing you are likely to want to do with a plug-in is define the location 
  of the plug-in's executable code and/or resources. <code><strong>library</strong></code> 
  entries in plugin.xml (see example below) describe the shape of these contributions. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;plugin
    id="com.example.myplugin"
    name="My Plugin"
    version="2.0.0"
    provider-name="Example Plug-ins Inc."&gt;

  <strong>&lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;library name="mylibrary.jar" type=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
      &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
    &lt;/library&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;
</strong>
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><code><strong>library</strong></code> elements specify a portion of the plug-in's 
  local classpath. Each plug-in has two classpaths: one for code libraries and 
  one for resource libraries. Correspondingly, <code><strong>library</strong></code> 
  elements have a type attribute whose value is either <code><strong>code</strong></code> 
  or <code><strong>resource</strong></code> (<code><strong>code</strong></code> 
  is the default). Code libraries contain Java class files as well as any associated 
  resources. There is no need to artificially separate resources from the code 
  as code libraries can contain both. Libraries defined as type <code><strong>resource</strong></code> 
  on the other hand, can contain only resources (properties files, images).</p>
<p>The distinction allows the classloaders to ignore resource libraries while 
  loading classes, as they are guaranteed to contain only resources (e.g., translated 
  properties files). This translates into performance improvements as there are 
  fewer places to look for classes. Note that both the code and resource libraries 
  are consulted when loading resources.</p>
<p>Each <strong><code>library</code></strong> element identifies a files system 
  location (directory or jar file) which contains the code and/or resources. The 
  path specified is relative to the plug-in's file system directory and cannot 
  resolve to a location outside the scope of the plug-in (for example, &quot;../../foo.jar&quot; 
  is not allowed). </p>
<p>By default, everything in a code library is considered private (i.e., known 
  only within the scope of the plug-in). Portions of a library are made visible 
  outside its containing plug-in using the <strong><code>export</code></strong> 
  sub-element. Plug-ins can export some, all or none of their libraries by specifying 
  patterns in the name attribute of the <strong><code>export</code></strong> tag. 
</p>
<p>A <strong><code>library</code></strong> entry contained in our example plug-in, 
  <code>com.example.myplugin</code> is shown in the snippet above. It shows a 
  code library called &quot;mylibrary.jar&quot; which is exported in total.</p>
<h2>What is a Plug-in Prerequisite?</h2>
<p>Plug-ins must declare their dependencies on other plug-ins using a <strong><code>requires</code></strong> 
  element in their plug-in manifest file. Typically dependencies arise from inter-plug-in 
  class references. If a plug-in A requires plug-in B, plug-in B is said to be 
  a prerequisite of plug-in A. Continuing our example, the manifest below shows 
  the plugin.xml expressing a dependency on <code>com.example.anotherplugin</code>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;plugin
    id="com.example.myplugin"
    name="My Plug-in"
	 version="2.0.0"
    provider-name="Example Plug-ins Inc."&gt;<br>
  <strong>&lt;requires&gt;
    &lt;import plugin="com.example.anotherplugin"
        version=&quot;2.1.3&quot;
        match=&quot;equivalent&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/requires&gt;
</strong>
  &lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;library name="mylibrary.jar" type=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
      &lt;export name="*"/&gt;
    &lt;/library&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;

&lt;/plugin&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, <code>com.example.myplugin</code> (My Plugin) can access any 
  of the classes in <code>com.example.anotherplugin</code> (Another Plugin) which 
  are explicitly exported in its library statements. </p>
<p>Notice that the <strong><code>import</code></strong> statement is qualified 
  by a version number and matching rule. Versions refine the dependencies between 
  plugins and help the runtime choose between different installations of the same 
  plug-in. In general the runtime picks the most recent version which matches 
  given the matching rule. Eclipse version numbers are a four part string of the 
  form <strong><code>major.minor.service.tag</code></strong>. Versions are compared 
  using one of four matching rules.</p>
<dl>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>perfect</b></dt>
    <dd>All four components of the version must match.</dd>
    <dt><b>equivalent</b></dt>
    <dd>major and minor must match and others must sort after</dd>
    <dt><b>compatible</b> (default)</dt>
    <dd>major must match and others must sort after</dd>
    <dt><b>greaterOrEqual</b></dt>
    <dd>Any version which is a perfect match or sorts lexographically after</dd>
  </dl>
</dl>
<p>Plug-in dependencies are transitive. That is, if Another Plugin requires some
   plug-in, say Final Plugin, then My Plugin will not be enabled unless both
  Another 
  Plugin and Final Plugin are present. This is easy to see since Another Plugin
   would be disabled if its prerequisites are not present (e.g., Final Plugin
  is missing). Similarly, My Plugin would also be disabled if its prerequisite,
  Another  Plugin, is not present. Under no circumstances are circular dependencies
  permitted. 
  Any plug-in involved in a cycle will be disabled at runtime.</p>
<p>Class visibility through the dependency chain is not transitive unless explicitly
  stated. That is, My Plugin cannot see the classes in Final Plugin. This effectively
  encapsulates
  the implementation of Another Plugin. Where transitivity is required, the <code><strong>export</strong></code> 
  attribute of the <strong><code>import</code></strong> tag is used to re-export
   the classes exported by imported plug-ins. (try saying that a few times quickly!).
  
  For example, Another 
  Plugin can explicitly re-export its import of Final Plugin:</p>
 <blockquote>
  <pre>    &lt;import plugin="com.example.finalplugin" export=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, plug-in prerequisite statements can be made optional by adding the 
  <strong><code>optional=&quot;true&quot;</code></strong> attribute to the <strong><code>import</code></strong> 
  tag (see below for an example). Marking an import as <code>optional</code> simply 
  states that if the specified plug-in is not found at runtime, the dependent 
  plug-in should be left enabled. This is used when a plug-in can be used in many 
  scenarios or it is reasonable to operate with reduced function. It allows the 
  creation of minimal installs that cover functional subsets. Authors of plug-ins 
  using optional prerequisites should take special care to avoid or handle the 
  ClassNotFoundExceptions which will occur when the optional plug-in is not present.</p>
<pre>    &lt;import plugin="com.example.finalplugin" optional=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<h2>What are Extensions and Extension Points?</h2>
<p><em>Extension points</em> are a mechanism used by plug-ins to indicate they 
  are willing to accept contributions from other plug-ins. An <em>extension</em> 
  is a plug-in's way of contributing information to these extension points. For 
  example, a UI plug-in might expose an extension point for menu actions. A plug-in 
  wishing to contribute an action to the UI would define an extension for the 
  UI's menu action extension point.</p>
<p>Extension points have a globally unique id constructed from the defining plug-in 
  id and a simple id specified in the extension point itself. The example below 
  is from the <code>org.eclipse.ui</code> plug-in. The full identifier of the 
  extension point is therefore <code>org.eclipse.ui.actionSets</code>. All extension 
  points have this relatively simple form.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>  &lt;extension-point name="Action Sets" id="actionSets"/&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The exact form of extensions is defined by the plug-in which defines the extension
   point being extended. In the above example, the UI plug-in specifies what
  information 
  is needed to define the menu action as well as the form of that information.
   For example, the UI needs an icon and label to draw and a class to instantiate
  and run when the menu entry 
  is selected. Extensions which identify classes to run are called  <em>executable
  extensions</em>. The type characteristics (e.g., superclass,
  interfaces) of the class are also defined by the extension point itself. The
  snippet below shows
  an example UI extension.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>  &lt;extension
      point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.actionSets&quot;&gt;
    &lt;actionSet
        label=&quot;Example&quot;
        visible=&quot;false&quot;
        id=&quot;com.example.actions&quot;&gt;
      &lt;action
          id=&quot;com.example.action1&quot;
          class=&quot;com.example.CoolAction&quot;
          icon=&quot;icons/action1.gif&quot;
          label=&quot;Cool Action&quot;
      &lt;/action&gt;
    &lt;/actionSet&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;
</pre>
  </blockquote>
<p>A plug-in can define any number of extension points and extensions. Further,
  any given extension point may be extended by any number of extensions. Extensions
  can extend extension points defined in their own plug-in or in
  others. It follows, therefore, that extension points can accept extensions
  from their own plug-in or other plug-ins. </p>
<p>Extending an extension point does not imply a dependency relationship. Rather,
   it is a statement that if there is an extension point with the given id (point
  
  attribute in the <strong><code>extension</code></strong> tag), add the given
   extension. Otherwise, do nothing. Doc plug-ins for example have no need to
  get classes from the Help plug-ins -- they simply add extensions to Help system
  extension points.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h2>What is a Plug-in Fragment?</h2>
<p>Fragments allow optional functionality/content to be <strong>added</strong> 
  to existing plug-ins. For example, the base Eclipse contains only English messages. 
  Fragments are used to add message catalogs containing other languages (e.g., 
  French, Italian) without modifying the existing plug-ins. Note that fragments 
  can only add function/content to plug-ins. They cannot override that which the 
  plug-in already contains. Fragments are added to the base plug-in in no particular 
  order and fragments for missing plug-ins are ignored.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to find that fragments are very similar to plug-ins; they 
  are defined with a single manifest file, called <strong><code>fragment.xml</code></strong>, 
  in a file system directory which contains everything the fragment needs. Each 
  fragment must be associated with a particular plug-in. And any given plug-in 
  can have any number of fragments associated with it. </p>
<p>Further, fragments can contribute libraries, prerequisites, extension points 
  or extensions using standard syntax. These contributions are seamlessly merged 
  into the fragment's base plug-in. That is, extensions and extension points from 
  a fragment appear to come from/be part of (respectively) the base plug-in, libraries 
  are put on the base plug-in's classpath and prerequisites contribute to the 
  plug-in's prerequisite chain.</p>
<p>Below, is an example of a simple NL fragment for <code>com.example.myplugin</code>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;fragment
    id="com.example.myplugin.addon1"  	  
    name="Example Add-on 1 Fragment"
    version="2.1.2"
    provider-name="Eclipse.org"
    plugin-id="com.example.myplugin"
    plugin-version="2.1.0"
    match="compatible"&gt;

  &lt;runtime&gt;<br>    &lt;library name="nl1.jar"/&gt;<br>  &lt;/runtime&gt;<br>&lt;/fragment&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This fragment contributes additional jars which contain translations of the
   messages used by the hosting plug-in itself. In this case the jar contains
  files named 
  according to the standard Java locale-based lookup strategy (e.g., message_en_US.properties,
   message_jp_JP.properties). Since the jars are added to the plug-in's classpath,
  
  the plug-in classloader will find these resources automatically. </p>
<h2>The Plug-in Model at Runtime</h2>
<p>All of the information we have discussed so far has dealt with physical plug-in
   information stored in the Eclipse environment. We will now talk about the <em>runtime</em> 
  version of all this plug-in information.</p>
<h4>The Plug-in Registry</h4>
<p>When the Eclipse Platform starts, it first discovers all available plug-ins 
  and fragments. The install/update component of Eclipse and a user-defineable 
  plug-in path are used to determine directories where plug-ins and fragments 
  can be found. Each plug-in/fragment directory may contain exactly one manifest 
  file named <code>plugin.xml </code>or <code>fragment.xml</code>. </p>
<p> Once the discovery is completed, the platform parses the discovered manifest
   files and builds a <em>plug-in registry</em>. Manifests which cannot be loaded
    are skipped and the failure is noted in the platform's log (typically under
   
  in <code>&lt;workspace&gt;/.metadata/.log</code>). The registry is
  then 
  <em>resolved.</em> That is, it is examined to ensure the structure is useful
   and sane, and its structures are cross linked. Resolution includes the following
  
  steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>each element in the list (plug-in, fragment, extension point, etc.) must 
    have all of the required fields. Required fields are those fields with the 
    tag &quot;#REQUIRED&quot; in the appendix &quot;DTD's for plugin.xml and fragment.xml".</li>
  <li>each fragment must be associated with a plug-in</li>
  <li>each plug-in must have access to any prerequisite plug-ins (after version 
    compatibility matching) unless a prerequisite has been denoted as <code>optional</code></li>
  <li>each extension must be matched with an extension point</li>
</ul>
<p>An error message is logged if any problems are encountered and the offending 
  element is removed from the plug-in registry. This allows Eclipse to continue 
  running even if there are minor problems. The resulting plug-in registry is 
  available via the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code> plug-in's API. The whole 
  plug-in registry is available through <code>IPluginRegistry</code> and individual 
  plug-ins can be examined with <code>IPluginDescriptor</code>.</p>
<p>Changes to the set of installed plug-ins are only detected when Eclise is
  restarted.</p>
<h4>Plug-in Activation</h4>
<p>When Eclipse starts up, only those plug-ins needed to build the plug-in registry 
  and get things started are activated. All other plug-ins (the vast majority 
  of plug-ins) remain dormant. When something happens causing the code within 
  a plug-in to be loaded, that particular plug-in is activated. That is, classloading 
  is the only trigger for plug-in activation. Plug-ins are only activated if the 
  class loaded comes from the plug-in's local classpath (i.e., one of its libraries). 
  Loading classes from a prerequisite does not count. This is the basis for Eclipse's 
  lazy plug-in activation policy.</p>
<p>Many things can happen without activating a plug-in. In particular, </p>
<ul>
  <li>resources can be loaded (either from a resource or code library) </li>
  <li>plug-in classloaders can ask other classloaders to load classes. </li>
  <li>extensions and extension points can be examined without having to activate 
    the plug-in that contains the extension. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once a plug-in is activated it remains active until Eclipse shuts down. When 
  Eclipse does shut down, all plug-ins are shut down in a dependents-first order. 
  For example, if plug-in A requires plug-in B, then plug-in A will be shut down 
  before plug-in B.</p>
<h4>Plug-in Classloading</h4>
<p>Libraries define the local classpath of a plug-in. Each library entry translates 
  into an entry on the classpath of the plug-in's classloader. Earlier we discussed 
  the concept of a <strong><code>code</code></strong> vs. a <strong><code>resource</code></strong> 
  library. Resource libraries are loaded by a resource loader and do not figure 
  into the strict classloading model.</p>
<p>Classloading in Eclipse follows the P-S-P model. That is, Parent-Self-Prerequisites. 
</p>
<dl> 
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Parent</b> </dt>
    <dd>Each plug-in classloader has the Eclipse boot plug-in's classloader as 
      its parent. The boot plug-in loader's parent is the system classloader. 
      Note that the standard Java AppClassloader (the one used to load the class 
      containing main()) is not added to the classloading chain. As a result, 
      the jars added to the JVM's classpath are ignored. Jars added to the JVM's 
      bootclasspath are part of the system classloader and are considered during 
      plug-in classloading.</dd>
    <dt><b>Self</b></dt>
    <dd>Self considers the libraries defined as part of this plug-in. All code 
      libraries contributed by fragments to this plug-in are also considered. 
      Libraries contributed by fragments appear after those contributed in the 
      plug-in manifest (in indeterminant order). Libraries from the same manifest 
      appear on the class path in the same order in which they were declared.</dd>
    <dt><b>Prerequisites</b></dt>
    <dd>Finally the exported libraries of the plug-in's prerequisites are considered. 
      Prerequisites are queried in the order in which they were declared with 
      the exception of the runtime plugin (<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>). 
      All plug-ins automatically have the Eclipse runtime plug-in (<code>org.eclipse.core.runtime</code>) 
      added to their prerequisite list as the first prerequisite. All imports 
      of the runtime plug-in are ignored. 
      <p> Note that prerequisite consultation is transitive. When locating a class, 
        a prerequisite plug-in will follow the same (though optimized) P-S-P model. 
        Since all plug-in classloaders have the same parent, prerequisite loaders 
        need not look there. Similarly, plug-ins which occur repeatedly in the 
        transitive closure of the prerequisite graph are consulted at most once. 
        Finally, prerequisite re-exporting rules are followed as described above.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
</dl>
<h4>Plug-in Data</h4>
                               
      
<p>The Eclipse Platform makes certain assumptions about the physical structure 
  of a plug-in. Each plug-in or fragment is typically stored in a separate directory 
  under a directory named <strong><code>plugins</code></strong> under your Eclipse 
  install directory. The name of this directory is usually the same as the plug-in's 
  id (though it may have the version number appended to it). In addition to the 
  <code>plugin.xml</code> or <strong><code>fragment.xml</code></strong> file, 
  there may be any number of folders under the plug-in's root folder.</p>
<p>Since Eclipse can be run on a wide range of machine configurations (i.e., operating 
  system, window system) it needs a way of managing different forms of the same 
  data (e.g., shared libraries). Eclipse provides four variables for use in library 
  statements which resolve to parts of the current machine configuration.</p>
<dl> 
  <dl>
    <dt><b>os</b></dt>
    <dd>The operating system on which Eclipse is currently running (e.g., win32, 
      linux, solaris)</dd>
    <dt><b>ws</b></dt>
    <dd>The window system being used for the Eclipse UI (e.g., win32, motif, gtk)</dd>

<p>So, for example, if your plug-in uses windowing system-specific features, it 
  may be necessary to provide a different library for each configuration. Using<em> 
  </em><strong><code>$ws$/&lt;library name&gt;</code></strong> in your plug-in 
  manifest file directs Eclipse to look for the library in a window system directory 
  with the same name as the current window system. The <code>org.eclipse.swt</code> 
  plug-in uses this mechanism as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>  &lt;runtime&gt;
    &lt;library name=&quot;$ws$/swt.jar&quot;&gt;
      &lt;export name=&quot;*&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/library&gt;
  &lt;/runtime&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The SWT plug-in has a series of directories of the form <code>ws/&lt;windowing
     system&gt;/</code>(e.g., <code>ws/win32</code>, <code>ws/gtk</code>, <code>ws/motif</code>).
      Each of these directories contains a different version of <code>swt.jar</code>.
       If you are working in an Eclipse environment in a win32 windowing system,
      the 
  library name <code>$ws$/swt.jar</code> will match <code>ws/win32/swt.jar</code>.
   Note that in practice any given Eclipse install will have only one <code>swt.jar</code> 
  (the one that matches the install). The jars are actually contributed by window
   system-specific fragments. Similar structures are seen in the Resources, and
  Update plug-ins. This mechanism allows the common elements to be put
   in the plug-in and have only the window system, operating system, ... specific
  parts in a fragment.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This article has set the stage for plug-ins: defining what they are, why they
  are important and concepts related to them. More detail on the exact form of
  <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help21/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/plugin_manifest.html">plug-in/fragment
  markup</a> can be found in the Eclipse help system. Eclipse plug-in developers
  are encouraged to look at existing plug-ins for further examples.</p>
