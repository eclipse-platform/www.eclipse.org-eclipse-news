    <td class="title">Initial Eclipse 4 API released</td>
    <td class="content">
      As was announced at EclipseCon this year, the first set of official API based on the new Eclipse 
      Platform 4 architecture is now available. This is the first step in allowing developers to use the 
      new simpler and more powerful mechanisms to build Eclipse plug-ins and applications.
    <p>
      This API is comprised of two basic concepts:
    </p><p>
      <b>The user interface model</b>: The content of this model describes the structure of the user interface.
      The Eclipse Platform reacts to changes in this model by updating the presentation, and the complete
      model is now available through the new API.
    </p><p>
      Note that the model represents everything on the screen and these elements can be modified
      by your code (see the example below).
    </p><p>
      <b>IEclipseContext / Dependency Injection (DI)</b>: Contexts are containers of UI runtime state
      including all the available services. The typical Eclipse Platform 4 pattern is that contributions
      are created and configured through dependency injection based on state and services found in the local
      context for that model element.
    </p><p>
      Here are a few links to more information about the UI Model, the services and DI (the Javadoc and supporting
      Eclipse documentation will be available before Kepler is released):

    <p>
      There is quite a lot of information already available for Eclipse Platform 4. While parts of the API are just being
      formalized now, most of the concepts and API existed in provisional form in previous Eclipse 4 releases.
    </p><p>
      Just to give a taste of what working in a modeled UI is all about, here's a code snippet showing
      how to get a 'standard' Command handler to toggle the visibility of the 'Quick Access' text field
      that appears in the top trim. First we gain access to the model by getting the MApplication as a
      'service'. Form there we can access the EModelService and use it to find the model element
      representing the search in the UI. Then it's just a simple matter of toggling the element's
      'toBeRendered' flag to get it to (dis)appear.
    </p>
    <pre>
public Object execute(ExecutionEvent event) throws ExecutionException {
  IWorkbenchWindow window = HandlerUtil.getActiveWorkbenchWindowChecked(event);		
  MApplication theApp = (MApplication) window.getService(MApplication.class);
  MWindow activeWin = theApp.getSelectedElement();
  EModelService ms = activeWin.getContext().get(EModelService.class);
  EPartService ps = activeWin.getContext().get(EPartService.class);
  MToolControl search = (MToolControl) ms.find("SearchField", activeWin);
  if (search != null) {
    search.setToBeRendered(!search.isToBeRendered());
    window.getShell().layout(true, true);
  }
  return null;
}

     because you need the <code>.class</code> literal or you want to invoke a static method?
     Now, rather than deleting all the arguments manually,

      When editing the <b>Plug-ins</b> tab of an <b>Eclipse Application</b> launch configuration, the <b>Default
      Start level</b> and <b>Default Auto-start</b> settings chosen at the top of the tab will be used when launching with
      all workspace and enabled target plug-ins.  Previously this setting would only be used when launching a
      specific list of plug-ins.

  <tr id="pde-run-remembers-selection">
    <td class="title">Running from PDE editors remembers previous launch</td>
    <td class="content">
      The PDE editors allow applications to be launched from the top toolbar of the <b>Manifest</b>, <b>Plug-in</b>
      and <b>Product</b> editors.  By default PDE only provides one type of application to launch.  However, if you have additional tooling
      installed such as RAP Tools, different application launches will be available in a drop down menu.
      <p><img src="images/launch-order.png" alt="Ordering of launches in editor"/></p>
      <p>
      This menu now remembers which application was launched most recently and puts it at the top of the list.  The most
      recent choice will be launched if the run button is pressed.  The order is saved between workbench
      restarts.

      Applications that use the Eclipse Platform 4 workbench API can now
      use <b>JUnit Plug-in Test</b> launch configurations to test their plug-ins. Previously 
      the tests would require the 3.x workbench API from the <code>org.eclipse.ui</code> bundle to 
      hook into the workbench lifecycle.

  </tr>
  <tr id="support-pre-osgi-bundles">
    <td class="title">API Tools has limited support for pre-OSGi Eclipse plug-ins</td>
    <td class="content">
      Eclipse plug-ins created before 3.1 did not contain an OSGi bundle manifest.  API Tools
      can now convert the pre-OSGi plug-ins to valid components in an API baseline.  This allows
      analysis, use and freeze scans to process plug-ins that depend on pre-OSGi plug-ins instead
      of failing to resolve.
      <p><img src="images/use-scan.png" alt="Use scan launch configuration with pre-OSGi plug-ins"/></p>
      <p>
      An OSGi runtime is required to do the conversion.  Tasks run using Eclipse AntRunner
      or the API Use Report external tools launch configuration can convert the plug-ins.  Tasks
      run from the command line Ant runner will skip pre-OSGi plug-ins.

    <tr id="noreference-types">
    <td class="title">API Tools allows @noreference Javadoc tag on types</td>
    <td class="content">
      API Tools now allows the use of the <code>@noreference</code> Javadoc tag on types (classes, interfaces,
      annotations and enums).
      <p><img src="images/no-reference.png" alt="Type defining noreference Javadoc tag"/></p>
      <p>Placing this tag restricts the API so that any reference to that type or its members
      will be flagged as invalid API use.</p>
      <p><img src="images/using-no-reference.png" alt="Class trying to reference a type marked as noreference"/></p>
      <p>
      To mark a type in an API package as not being API, tag it as <code>@noreference</code>,
      <code>@noextend</code> and <code>@noinstantiate</code> (or <code>@noimplement</code>).  This ensures that
      no client can access it via valid API and the type could later be removed.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
    <tr id="api-tags-check-visibility">
    <td class="title">API Tools Javadoc tags check visibility</td>
    <td class="content">
      A member that is not publicly visible, such as a method or field marked private, is not part 
      of API.  Any API Tools Javadoc tags on it are invalid.  Now, API Tools will also check if a
      member is not visible because of the visibility of an enclosing type.  If the member is not visible,
      any tags on it will be considered invalid.
      <p><img src="images/api-parent-not-visible.png" alt="Javadoc tag flagged as invalid because member is not visible"/></p>
      <p>
      Tag validation is turned off by default.  To turn it on for your API Tools enabled project, open 
      <b>Project Properties > Plug-in Development > API Errors/Warnings</b>.  Set 
      <b>API Use > General > Unsupported use of API Javadoc tags</b> to <code>Warning</code> or <code>Error</code>.
