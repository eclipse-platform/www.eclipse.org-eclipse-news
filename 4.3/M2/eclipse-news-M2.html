<h1>Eclipse Project 4.3 M2 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>Here are some of the more noteworthy things available in milestone build M2 
  (September 21, 2012) which is now available for <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/" target="_top">download</a>.

  <tr id="detached-sash">
    <td class="title">Detached windows with sash</td>
    <td class="content">
      When you detach a view or editor into its own separate window, it now
      has all the capabilities of a normal workbench window. They now support multiple stacks of
      views separated by sashes with arbitrary layouts. The detached parts will remain synchronized
      with the master window that they were detached from. This is especially handy for people developing
      with two or more monitors, so they can spread views across several monitors and keep them synchronized.
