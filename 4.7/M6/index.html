  <tr id="unlikely-argument-types">
    <td class="title">Warnings for unlikely argument types</td>
    <td class="content">
      Many developers have learned the hard way, that certain uses of Java collections that pass the compiler's
      type check, may still contain "type errors", resulting in unexpected runtime behaviour. 
      A new analysis has been added to the Eclipse compiler for Java that will detect the most common bugs in this area.
      <p>
      	The common reason behind this problem is the fact that not all methods of those collection types make use of generics in the way one might expect.
      	As a result it is possible to create a <code>Set&lt;Short></code>, whose <code>add(Short)</code> method will only accept arguments of type <code>Short</code>,
      	yet method <code>remove(Object)</code> will happily accept literally any argument, because the method's parameter has type <code>Object</code>.
      </p> 
      <p>
      	Here is a code snippet that seems to add and remove the same element from the set, but at a closer look the <code>remove</code> call has no effect.
      	What is difficult to see for the naked eye is now flagged by a new warning:
      </p> 
      <p>
      	<a href="images/unlikely1.txt"><img src="images/unlikely1-basic.png" alt="Warning on last line: Unlikely argument type int for remove(Object) on a Collection&lt;Short&gt;" /></a>
      </p>
      <p>
      	In a simple world, this would be all there is to say, but over time people have developed various code patterns
      	that rely on these overly general signatures. Consider the following use of subtyping:
      </p>
      <p>
      	<a href="images/unlikely2.txt"><img src="images/unlikely2-number-allowed.png" alt="" /></a>
      </p>
      <p>
      	Depending on your coding style this may or may not be accepted as a legitimate short hand for:
      	<br/><code style="margin-left:2em;">if (n instanceof Short) set.remove((Short) n);</code><br/>
      	To reduce the churn caused by the new analysis, we developed some heuristics that filter out cases where types are "sufficiently similar",
      	so the above goes unwarned.
      </p>
      <p>
      	As with any heuristic, there is no clear line. This implies that the compiler may show "unwanted" warnings, 
      	or filter out invocations that are in fact bugs. For the former case, <code>@SuppressWarnings("unlikely-arg-type")</code>
      	will document the exception both for the user and for the compiler. For the latter case, we provide an option to tighten
      	the rules, namely to apply strict type compatibility checks instead of said heuristics. For this extra scrutiny you may enable
      	the sub-option <b>Perform strict analysis against the expected type</b> in <b>Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Compiler &gt; Errors/Warnings &gt; Potential programming problems</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
      	<img src="images/unlikely3-options.png" alt="Preference options" />
      </p>
<!-- 
      With this option enabled, above usage is flagged indeed (and the same for less obvious cases, which would be filtered out by the heuristics):
      <p>
      	<a href="images/unlikely4.txt"><img src="images/unlikely4-number-strict.png" alt="" /></a>
      </p>
 -->
      Similarly, a check with default severity "Info" is offered for unlikely invocations of <code>java.lang.Object.equals(Object)</code> and 
      <code>java.util.Objects.equals(Object,Object)</code>. 
      <p>
      	<a href="images/unlikely5.txt"><img src="images/unlikely5-equals.png" alt="Info on last line: Unlikely argument type for equals(): Name seems to be unrelated to String" /></a>

      This allows more space for comments in heavily indented blocks of code and for line comments
      added to the right of some code, but at the same time keeps comments that start at the beginning
      of the line from getting too wide and uncomfortable to read.
      <p>You can change this setting in the <b>Comments</b> section, under the <b>Line width</b> group:</p>

    <td class="content">
      The <code>ImageDescriptor</code> and <code>CompositeImageDescriptor</code> classes in
      <code>org.eclipse.jface.resource</code> are now fully ready for HiDPI images. In
      Neon (4.6), only <code>ImageDescriptor#createFromURL(URL)</code>
      <a href="../../4.6/platform_isv.php#high-dpi-icons">supported high-resolution images</a>.
      <p>
      Clients that use <code>DecorationOverlayIcon</code> will get HiDPI support for free.
      Subclasses of <code>CompositeImageDescriptor</code> will have to update their implementation of
      <code>#drawCompositeImage(int, int)</code> to use the new <code>#drawImage(ImageDataProvider, int, int)</code>
      method to draw the elements of the composite image.
      </p>
      Old code:
      <pre>
protected void drawCompositeImage(int width, int height) {
	// draw overlay in top-right corner:
	<b>ImageData</b> imageData = myImageDescriptor.<b>getImageData()</b>;
	drawImage(imageData, width - imageData<b>.width</b>, 0);
}
      </pre>
      HiDPI-aware code:
      <pre>
protected void drawCompositeImage(int width, int height) {
	// draw overlay in top-right corner:
	<b>CachedImageDataProvider</b> provider =
		<b>createCachedImageDataProvider</b>(myImageDescriptor);
	drawImage(provider, width - provider<b>.getWidth()</b>, 0);
}
      </pre>
      <p>
      Hint: Use <code>CompositeImageDescriptor<span style="visibility:hidden">&shy;</span>#createCachedImageDataProvider(<span style="visibility:hidden">&shy;</span>Image<span style="visibility:hidden">&shy;</span>/ImageDescriptor)</code> to create an
      <code>ImageDataProvider</code>. To calculate the width and height of the image
      that is about to be drawn, you can use
      <code>CachedImageDataProvider<span style="visibility:hidden">&shy;</span>#getWidth()/<span style="visibility:hidden">&shy;</span>getHeight()</code>. These methods
      already return values in SWT points, so that your code doesn't have to
      deal with device-dependent pixel coordinates.
