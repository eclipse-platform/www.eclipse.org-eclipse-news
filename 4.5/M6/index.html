      For Mars M6, the Eclipse SDK for OS X is now distributed in a more standard "Mac App" format, 
      instead of the "directory format" we have used in the past. See <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431116">bug 431116</a> 
      for background, current status, and pointers to remaining work planned.
      <p id="updatecaution"><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Current Mac users can <strong>not use "update"</strong> to Mars M6. In fact, 
      for M6, <strong>doing so will break your installation!</strong> You need to start with a fresh download.
      </p>
      <p>In the event that 
      you updated before reading this, and have ended up with a broken installation, see

  <tr id="mru-tabs">
    <td class="title">"Visible tabs shown on overflow" behavior decoupled from appearance theme</td>
    <td class="content">
      In Eclipse 4.2, the non-"Classic" themes introduced a new strategy to select the editor tabs shown
      when there's not enough screen space to show all tabs. The new strategy shows a sliding
      window of tabs in their original opening sequence, cutting off tabs at the beginning and/or end of
      the full sequence.
      
      <p>In classic versions of Eclipse (before 4.2, and later with a "Classic" theme), the strategy
      was to show the most recently used tabs (MRU), i.e. the "working set" of tabs you're currently using.
      </p>
      
      <p>The coupling of behavior with styling (themes) was found to be problematic, and the
      tab visibility has has been turned into a separate preference. See
      <b>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Appearance &gt; Show most recently used tabs</b>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <img src="images/mru-preference.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      
      <p>
      By default, the option is <b>disabled</b>. Users of a "Classic" theme need to enable it manually
      to keep the behavior they're used to.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Plugin developers and Eclipse product owners can change via preferences whether
      the CSS theme or a user preference should control this option, and
      whether MRU should be enabled by default. The preferences are for the
      "org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt" plug-in, and the keys are:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      "MRUControlledByCSS" (default is "false"),
      </li>
      <li>
      "enableMRUDefault" (default is "false"),

  <tr id="high-dpi">
    <td class="title">APIs for high-DPI monitor support</td>
    <td class="content">
      New APIs have been added to provide support for rendering high-resolution images on high-DPI monitors.
      <p>
      Two constructors have been added to the <code>Image</code> class. They accept
      image-provider callbacks that allow clients to supply resolution-dependent versions
      of images:
      </p>
      <pre>public interface ImageDataProvider {
	public ImageData getImageData (int zoom);
}
public interface ImageFileNameProvider {
	public String getImagePath (int zoom);
}</pre>
      
      <p>
      Depending on the user's monitor configuration, SWT will request images with the
      corresponding zoom level. Here's an example that displays 3 original images,
      followed by variants whose resolution changes depending your monitor's resolution:
      <a href="http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.swt.git/plain/examples/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet367.java">Snippet367.java</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Note that this is just the first step to support high-resolution images in
      SWT and Eclipse-based applications. Work is underway to adopt the new APIs in
      the platform. Futhermore, more work in SWT is required to properly
      support drawing into high-resolution images via <code>GC</code>.

    <td class="content">
      Annotation-based null analysis can now leverage externally defined annotations that are attached to a library.
      <p>
      	Previously, annotation-based null analysis was significantly limited by the fact
      	that many 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries have no null annotations in their API.
      	This implied that any errors caused at this interface could not be detected by the analysis,
      	and even worse, implementors of library-defined interfaces could not use any intended contracts,
      	because any null annotations in overriding methods were flagged as incompatible with the super version.
      </p>
      <p>
      	JDT now supports the concept of "external annotations".
      	A user can specify null annotations in separate files and attach these to a given library.
      	The compiler will take external null annotations into consideration for its null analysis.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Configuration:</strong></p>
      <p><img src="images/external-annotation-configuration.png" title="Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs &gt; Edit" alt="Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Installed JREs &gt; Edit"/></p>
      <p>External annotations can be provided as a directory tree of individual text files or as a zip file.
      	External annotations can be attached to a JRE (per workspace) and to arbitrary libraries (per project).
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>See below for creating external annotations using the new command <b>Annotate</b></li>
      <li>See <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/JDT_Core/Null_Analysis/External_Annotations">the wiki</a> for the full story.</li>

      A new command <b>Annotate</b> is provided when browsing attached source code of a library using the class file editor.
      <p>
      	Two pre-requisites must be met for using this command:
      </p>
      <ul>
     	<li>The project is configured to use annotation-based null analysis.</li>
     	<li>An existing workspace folder has been specified as the external annotation location for a given library.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      	Users may select any type in the signature of a library method or field, and invoke <b>Annotate</b> -
      	either using the context menu, or by pressing <b>Ctrl+1</b>.
      	Proposals will be offered for marking the selected type as <code>@NonNull</code> or <code>@Nullable</code>.
      	All method parameters, return types and field types can be annotated.
      	Additionally when Java 8 is used, details like type arguments and type bounds etc. can be annotated.
      </p>
      <p><img src="images/annotate-map-return.png" alt=""/></p>
      <p>After selecting a proposal, the compiler will immediately leverage the new annotation for its null analysis.

      <p>Implementations of this method should also be updated. This has already been done
      for some platform APIs like <code>org.eclipse.ui.part.WorkbenchPart</code>. Callers and implementers
      of these APIs can see compile errors or warnings due to this binary-compatible change.</p>
