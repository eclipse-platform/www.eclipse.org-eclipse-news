<ol>
  <li><b><a name="about_8">What is eclipse?</a></b> 
    <p>Eclipse is an open source software development project dedicated to providing 
      a robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, industry platform for the development 
      of highly integrated tools. It is composed of three projects, the <a href="../index.html">Eclipse 
      Project</a>, the <a href="../../tools/index.html">Eclipse Tools Project</a> 
      and the <a href="../../technology/index.html">EclipseTechnology Project</a>, 
      each of which is overseen by a Project Management Committee (PMC) and governed 
      by its Project Charter. Each project is composed of its own subprojects 
      and is licensed under the <a href="../../legal/main.html">CPL version 1.0</a>.

  <li><b><a name="about_2">What is the Eclipse Project?</a></b> 
    <p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/index.html">Eclipse Project</a> 
      is an open source software development project dedicated to providing a 
      robust, full-featured, commercial-quality, industry platform for the development 
      of highly integrated tools. It is composed of three subprojects, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/platform/index.html">Platform</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jdt/index.html">JDT - Java development tools</a>, 
      and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pde/index.html">PDE - Plug-in development 
      environment.</a> The success of the Eclipse Platform depends on how well 
      it enables a wide range of tool builders to build best of breed integrated 
      tools. But the real vision of eclipse as an industry platform is only realized 
      if these tools from different tool builders can be combined together by 
      users to suit their unique requirements, in ways that the tool builders 
      never even imagined. The mission of the Eclipse Project is to adapt and 
      evolve the Eclipse Platform and associated tools to meet the needs of the 
      tool building community and its users, so that the vision of eclipse as 
      an industry platform is realized.</p>

 <li><a name="about_9"><b>What is the Eclipse Tools Project?</b></a> 
    <p>The <a href="../../tools/index.html">Eclipse Tools Project</a> provides 
      a focal point for diverse tool builders to ensure the creation of best of 
      breed tools for the Eclipse Platform. The mission of Eclipse Tools Project 
      is to foster the creation of a wide variety of tools for the Eclipse Platform. 
      The Tools project provides single point of coordination for open source 
      tool developers in order to minimize overlap and duplication, ensure maximum 
      sharing and creation of common components, and promote seamless interoperability 
      between diverse types of tools. The Tools project is composed of subprojects 
      which are proposed, selected and developed by the community of tool developers 
      and the Tools Project PMC.</p>

  <li><a name="about_10"><b>What is the Eclipse Technology Project? </b></a>
    <p>The mission of the <a href="../../technology/index.html">Eclipse Technology 
      Project</a> is to provide new channels for open source developers, researchers, 
      academics and educators to participate in the on-going evolution of Eclipse. 
      It is organized as three related project streams, namely Research, Incubators 
      and Education. Research projects explore research issues in Eclipse-relevant 
      domains such as programming languages, tools, and development environments. 
      Incubators are small, informally structured projects which add new capabilities 
      to the Eclipse software base. Education projects focus on the development 
      of educational materials, teaching aids and courseware.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/platform/index.html">Eclipse Platform</a> 
      is an open extensible IDE for anything and yet nothing in particular. The 
      Eclipse Platform provides building blocks and a foundation for constructing 
      and running integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform 
      allows tool builders to independently develop tools that integrate with 
      other people's tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and 
      another starts.</p>
    <hr size="1">
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="about_4">What is the Eclipse SDK?</a></b> 
    <p>The Eclipse SDK (software developer kit) is the consolidation of the components 
      produced by the three Eclipse Project subprojects (Platform, JDT - Java 
      development tools, and PDE - Plug-in development environment) into a single 
      download.</p>
    <p> Together these pieces provide a feature-rich development environment that 
      allows the developer to efficiently create tools that integrate seamlessly 
      into the Eclipse Platform. </p>

  <li><b><a name="users_0.5">How do I run Eclipse?</a></b>
    <p>Running Eclipse is usually as simple as running the eclipse executable 
      in the top level eclipse directory. However you can specify extra parameters 
      to Eclipse and to the Java VM that is running Eclipse. One common example 
      is to increase the Java Heap size if you are getting Out of Memory Errors 
      when running large projects. <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help21/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">Here</a> 
      is a document on supported command line parameters.</p>
    <hr size="1"></li>
  <li><b><a name="users_1">What build should I download?</a></b> 
    <p>You should download either the latest release build or the most recent 
      stable development build. These builds are available from the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">downloads 
      page</a>. The latest release will have fewer bugs but the most recent stable 
      build will have all the latest features. If you are just getting started 
      it is safer to work with the latest release so you won't be confused by 
      random bugs in the latest stable development build. You should use only 
      release builds for any kind of production work. A notice will be posted 
      to the newsgroup when a new stable build is available.</p>
    <hr size="1">
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="users_1.5">What does a green check mark or a red 'X' mean on 
    the build download page?</a></b> 
    <p>The green check mark and the red 'X' are rough estimates of the quality 
      of the build.</p>
    <p>A green check mark means the build passed the following tests or is considered 
      stable enough for use by the eclipse development team. A build will a green 
      check can still have bugs and regressions! 
    <ol>
      <li>The plug-ings compile.</li>
      <li>The automated tests all pass.</li>
      <li>The build passes a five to ten minute human-driven sniff test.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the build fails any of the tests it is marked with a red 'X'.</p>
    <hr size="1">

  <li><b><a name="users_2">Which operating systems does the Eclipse Platform support?</a></b> 
    <p>The 1.0 Release build of the Eclipse Platform was designed to run on Windows 
      XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows ME and Red Hat Linux Version 7.1 (x86/Motif).</p>
    <p>The most recent 2.0 builds of the Eclipse Platform are designed to run 
      on Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows ME, Red Hat Linux Version 
      7.1 (x86/Motif and x86/GTK)), SuSE Linux 7.1 (x86/Motif and x86/GTK) and 
      Solaris 8 (SPARC/Motif).</p>
    <p>More platforms are being added. For the information on which platforms 
      are supported in a given build visit the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">downloads 
      page</a>. Each build indicates the platforms it runs on. For more information

  </li>
  <li><b><a name="users_3">I have downloaded the Eclipse SDK, but it won't start. 
    How do I start eclipse?</a></b> 
    <p>The number one reason is that the JRE cannot be located to run eclipse. 
      You must have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer. 
      Eclipse requires version 1.3 or 1.4 of a Java 2 Standard Edition JRE. The 
      Eclipse SDK does <b>not</b> ship with a JRE.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you download and install a Java developer kit. The developer 
      kit will include a Java runtime that you can use to launch eclipse. Each 
      build page contains a link to a page of suggested developer kit and Java 
      runtime downloads that should work with the eclipse build. You can also 
      find these links to commercial vendors that supply Java developer kits and 
      Java runtime environments in the table below. You will need to decide for 
      yourself which works best for you, and which licensing terms work best for 
      you.</p>

    <p>The Eclipse Project uses <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a> 
      as its bug tracking system. Entering a bug report is as simple as filling 
      in a web form on the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/">eclipse bugzilla 
      page</a>. The first time you enter a bug you will need to <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/createaccount.cgi">create 
      a new bugzilla account</a> for yourself by providing an email address and 
      choosing a password.</p>
    <p>But <b>wait!</b> Before you enter a bug report, <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/query.cgi">search 
      bugzilla</a> to see if someone else has already entered a bug report similar 
      to yours. If you find a bug report that outlines the problem you are seeing, 
      you can simply annotate it with your comments to let the developers know 
      that you have also hit the bug.</p>
    <p>Once you have searched bugzilla and not found anything, you can go ahead 
      and enter a new bug report. Please read the bug writing guidelines located 
      on the <a href="http://dev.eclipse.org/bugzilla.html">eclipse bug reporting 
      page</a>.</p>
    <p>To make your bug report more helpful include the following in all bug reports 
      you submit:

      <li>The Eclipse SDK build you are using, for example, Eclipse SDK 20011206</li>
      <li>Your computer's specifications (OS, memory, other pertinent info)</li>

    <p>The .log file is located in the workspace/.metadata directory.</p>
    <p>The .log file is used by the Eclipse Platform to log runtime errors. It 
      is useful to include it in bug reports because it contains stacktraces that

  <li><b><a name="users_12">How do I bring my Java files into eclipse?</a></b> 
    <p>The best way to do bring your pre-existing Java files into eclipse is to 
      create a Java project and copy your files into the project. You can copy 
      the files into the project using a number of methods. You can: 
    <ul>
      <li>Use the import facility, File-&gt;Import...</li>
      <li>Copy the files into the project folder in the OS. Then right click on 
        the project and select Refresh From Local.</li>
      <li>(Win32 only) Drag the files from the desktop, a folder, or an Explorer 
        window into the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not want to copy the files, you can create a Java project that 
      is located at the folder that contains your Java source. For example, let's 
      say you have 5000 source files in directory tree under c:\work. You can 
      create a Java project and set its location to c:\work. To do this, uncheck 
      the "Use default location" check box in the new project wizard to specify 
      the location.</p>
    NOTE: Eclipse does <b>not</b> allow project locations to overlap.<br>
    <hr size="1">
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="users_12.5">When I delete a project eclipse asks if I want to 
    delete the content. What does this mean?</a></b> 
    <p>The Eclipse Platform stores your project contents in a directory. By default 
      this directory is in the workspace directory and is named with the project 
      name. When you delete a project, you are asked if you want to delete the 
      contents of this directory.</p>
    <p>In many cases it is desirable to delete the contents and the project entirely. 
      But when you have located your project in a location other than in the default 
      location, you may want to keep your files, and simply remove the project 
      from your Eclipse workspace.</p>
    <p>TIP: <b>Be careful!</b> If you have created a project in a location other 
      than the default location you can delete files that you did not intend to.</p>

    <p>When a project's build path is configured with an output folder, JDT generates 
      class files into this folder and copies resources inside the packages to 
      the output folder. This ensures that the resources will be found at runtime 
      by the running Java application. To avoid the resource copying, you can 
      do one of the following.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not use source folders and set the output folder to the project itself</li>
      <li>Put your resources that should not be copied into a folder (for example,

      &quot;Cannot use classic compiler, as it is not available. A common solution 
      is to set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to your JDK directory.&quot;</p>
    <p>To workaround this problem, you can add tools.jar to the Ant classpath

  <li><b><a name="users_18">How do I use eclipse to debug a Java program running 
    on another machine?</a></b> 
    <p>To debug a remote Java program follow these steps: 
    <ol>
      <li>Start eclipse.</li>
      <li>Switch to the Java Perspective, Perspective-&gt;Open-&gt;Java.</li>
      <li>Create a new Java Project by clicking on the "Create a new Java Project" 
        button in the toolbar.</li>
      <li>If you have source for your program, you can import it into the new 
        project, so that the debugger shows source while you are debugging. This 
        also allows you to set breakpoints in the remote program.</li>
      <li>Launch your Java program on the remote machine. Make sure you add the following 
        to the command line arguments so that the Java program will be debug enabled: 
        <ul>
          -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=n,suspend=n,address=8000 
          -Djava.compiler=NONE 
        </ul>
        <p>TIP: You can change the address value to specify any port you would 
          like to use, just remember what you changed it to, you will need it 
          later.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Select the Java Project you have just created.</li>
      <li>Select Run-&gt;Debug...</li>
      <li>Select Remote Java Application and click "New"</li>
      <li>Enter the host and the port number of your remote Java program. Enter 
        this information and click "Finish".</li>
      <li>The debugger will connect to the remote Java program and switch to the 
        Debug perspective.</li>
    </ol>
    <p></p>
    <p>TIP: This setup forces your Java program to wait until the debugger connects 
      to it before executing. If you are debugging a program that does not need 
      to be debugged during startup, you can change the command line argument 
      &quot;server=n&quot; to &quot;server=y&quot;. This is useful for debugging 
      web servers and similar programs.</p>
    <p>TIP: You can use this technique to connect to Java programs you have launched 
      on your local machine using the command line, simply leave the host as localhost 
      in the Launch Configuration Wizard.</p>

    can I do?</a></b> 
    <p>This answer to this question depends on the error message you get: 
    <ul>
      <li>If the dialog says "Problems encountered launching the Java VM in debug 
        mode", look at the reason for the failure to determine a possible solution. 
        The reason is an error message produced by the VM. For example, the error 
        message might say something like 
        <pre>
	"Error occurred during initialization of VM
	Could not find -Xrun library: jdwp.dll"
</pre>
        This error message indicates that the JRE you have specified to use for 
        debugging does not support debugging, or cannot locate the proper DLLs 
        required for debugging. Use a JRE that supports debugging or change the 
        JRE setup to point to the correct JRE root where the jdwp.dll can be found. 
        (Note: VMs before 1.3.x do not generally support debugging unless you 
        have installed extra debugging DLLs).</li>
      <li>If the dialog says "Timeout while waiting for VM to connect. Retry?", 
        This means the debugger has not yet received a connection from the VM 
        it has launched, and the VM has not reported any launching errors. In 
        this case, retry a few times. It is possible that the VM needs more time 
        to load/initialize itself.</li>

    <hr size="1">
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="users_19">Why can't I see variables in the debugger?</a></b> 
    <p>Some .class files are not compiled with debugging information. For example, 
      many class libraries contain classes that do not have debug information. 
      Without this information, the Java debugger cannot display variables.</p>

  <li><b><a name="plugin_1">What build should I download?</a></b>
    <p>If you are building tool plugins designed to run on a previously released
      version of the Eclipse Platform, you should download the corresponding release
      of the Eclipse SDK. However in most cases plug-in developers will want to
      use the most recent stable build of the Eclipse SDK. These builds are used
      by the eclipse developers, and will have the most recent bug fixes and features.
      By using the latest stable build tool builders can stay on top of the latest
      changes and improvements and provide feedback, bug reports, suggested fixes,
      and contribute to the evolution of eclipse. You can find the latest builds
      on the <a href="http://eclipse.org/downloads/index.html">downloads page</a>.
      A notice will be posted to the newsgroup when a new stable build is available.

  <li><b><a name="plugin_1.5">How does the Eclipse SDK build process work?</a></b>
    <p>Nightly builds of the Eclipse SDK are performed by building the current
      contents of the HEAD stream of the projects in the Eclipse Project CVS repository.</p>
    <p>Integration builds are performed on Tuesdays at noon EST. They are built
      using versions of projects located in the CVS repository. Each component
      team submits which version should be included in the build. The goal of
      the integration build is to create a stable build. Discussion about the
      problems with, and patches for, integration builds can be found on the eclipse-dev
      mailing list.</p>
    <p>The eclipse developers use each integration build to continue development.
      If the developers feel comfortable using an integration build, it is promoted
      to stable build status and it is posted to the builds page as a stable build.</p>
    <p>Release builds represent the culmination of a release cycle. They are rigorously
      tested stable builds that are designed for production use.</p>

  <li><b><a name="plugin_7">I have a Swing application. Can I integrate it into
    eclipse?</a></b>
    <p>Yes you can - but there are some significant limitations, and the integration
      is not as tight as when you build tools using SWT. The best way to integrate
      tools into eclipse is to use SWT. To understand this, let's look at the
      kinds of tool integration that are possible with the Eclipse Platform:<br>
      <br>
      <b>In-Place-Java-Tools</b> coded using the Eclipse Platform API's using
      JFace/SWT. This is the best integration approach and the mechanism that
      most eclipse tools use. These tools run in the same VM and same class libraries
      as the platform itself and can leverage the full integration API for seamless
      integration. These tools open in-place in the eclpse workbench and contribute
      views or editors into the workbench perspectives. Note that an In-Place-Java-Tool
      is coded in Java, but the Java code can also make use of an ActiveX control
      as part of its implementation (on the Windows platform only).</p>
    <p> <b>Launch-Java-Tools</b> coded in Java, using Swing or AWT.&nbsp; These
      tools run in the same VM and same class libraries as the eclipse workbench
      itself, but are otherwise loosely coupled and operate in much the same manner
      as External-Launch-Tools. This mechanism allows swing-in-process tools to
      be opened as separate windows (not in place).</p>
    <p> <b>External-Launch-Tools</b> coded in any language, that are launched
      as external programs. These tools open as separate windows and are&nbsp;not
      visually integrated into the workbench. The platform provides automatic
      launching of external editors based on file type associations provided by
      the user or obtained from the underlying operating system.</p>
    <p> <b>In-Place-OLE-Documents</b> (Windows platform only) allow standard OLE
      enabled tools that support in-place OLE documents (such as MSWord, MS Powerpoint,
      etc) to be invoked in place in the eclipse workbench to edit documents of
      the corresponding type. These tools are otherwise loosely integrated, and
      functionally they are the same as External-Launch tools i.e. they open on
      a document, edit it, save it.</p>
	      <hr size="1">
	  </li>

  <li><b><a name="plugin_7.25">What about swing-in-place?</a></b> <br>
    You can have a look at the SWT_AWT class which is an experimental mechanism
    that can be used to integrate swing widgets into eclipse in-place. However,
    there are some significant limitations associated with this:
    <ul>
      <li>It only works on Windows. &nbsp;Swing/AWT ships with a library that
        is linked in such a way that it does not export its X/motif libraries
        and this causes a problem where globals are concerned since SWT tries
        to use the same libraries. </li>
      <li>It does not work with light weight widgets. &nbsp;There are issues with
        the keystrokes getting sent to the light weight widget. </li>
      <li>It is experimental (in the internal package org.eclipse.swt.internal.awt.win32)
        and therefore the API may change. </li>
      <p>
    </ul>
	    <hr size="1">
  </li>
  <li><b><a name="plugin_7.5">What if I have existing swing code?</a></b>
    <p> SWT was designed to be small, fast, and leverage the native widget system
      available on each platform. In the area of high performance workstation
      tools, we believe this is very important. If you want native look and feel
      and good platform integration, then SWT is a good choice... and SWT is the
      best approach for integrating tools into the eclipse platform. For the best
      results Plug-in developers targeting tight eclipse integration should use
      SWT.&nbsp; Plug-in developers with existing swing based components should
      in most cases use the <b>Launch-Java-Tools</b> approach described above
      (yielding swing-in-process) as a stepping stone towards ultimately achieving
      tighter tool integration. The experimental internal mechanism for <b>swing-in-place</b>
      should be used only after considering the risks and limitations as indicated
      above.<br>

      to get involved and help.
    <ul>
      <li>You can participate in the newsgroups. There are many questions that

  <li><b><a name="misc_2"></a>What other programming languages does the Eclipse 
    Platform support?</b> 
    <p>The Eclipse Platform is a universal tool platform. It has no knowledge 
      of any specific language, but opens the door for plug-ins to support various 
      languages. Similarly, the platform provides support for building source 
      editors for specific programming languages but it doesn't actually include 
      those editors.</p>
    <p>The Eclipse SDK includes a full featured Java IDE. This is an example of
